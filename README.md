# _sailsim_ - A sail boat simulator
[![Python package](https://github.com/mfbehrens99/sailsim/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mfbehrens99/sailsim/actions/workflows/python-package.yml)

This sailboat simulation program is meant to test sailing algorithms. Provide the simulation a sailboat, some wind and a sailing algorithm and the boat will sail in this virtual world.

This project is developed by Tillman Keller & Michael Behrens.

This package can be downloaded from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/sailsim/) using `pip` by using the following command:

`pip install sailsim`

To install the package for development download the repository from [GitHub]. Navigate to the folder and add the `-e` option to the pip install command:

`pip install -e .`

## Usage
In `tests/basictest.py` is an example use of the module. For now the GUI is not reachable that easily, but updates will come!

## Documentation
The class diagram can be fond in the `docs` folder. The folder contains a class diagram that displays the structure of the project. Additionally, a sequence diagram explains how the simulation of in step is working.

## Contributing
We are happy for any support from other people. Especially if you are into QT GUI development or design we truly need your help!
